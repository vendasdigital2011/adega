## Core Principle: Marginal Capability

The final severity and priority of a finding are strictly bounded by the
**marginal capability** gained by the attacker over their prerequisite position.
If the exploit does not grant the attacker significant new control, access, or
capabilities beyond what is already inherent to their starting position (or
already possessed via legitimate means), the finding must be capped or
downgraded.

______________________________________________________________________

### Category A: Force-Downgrade to LOW (Cap at 2.0 / LOW Priority)

01. **`repro_failure` (Reproduction Failure or Not Attempted)** The reproduction
    failed (`repro_status: "failed_to_reproduce"`), was not attempted
    (`repro_status: "not_attempted"`), or the `repro_status` field was missing
    (treated as `"not_attempted"`), regardless of theoretical production
    viability.

    **Snapshot carve-out (STALE_EVIDENCE):** do NOT fire this rule when the
    finding is NOT_MATCHED to the active snapshot, or its `code_paths` file is
    absent under the pinned CODE_ROOT (see the STALE-EVIDENCE guard in
    `mantis-calibrate/SKILL.md`). A failed/absent reproduction against drifted
    or missing code is uninformative; keep the higher score and mark
    `calibration_checklist.repro_failure.outcome = "UNKNOWN"` with a
    `STALE_EVIDENCE:` reason instead of force-LOW.

02. **`unreachable_inputs` (Unreachable / Uncontrolled Inputs)** The finding
    relies on inputs that are documented as highly unlikely to be
    user-controlled, and no path from a trust boundary is proven.

03. **`third_party_reachability` (Third-Party / Supply Chain Reachability)**
    Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (dependency CVEs) where a reachable
    path from application input to the vulnerable function has not been actively
    demonstrated.

04. **`minor_config_hygiene` (Minor Configuration Hygiene)** Minor deviations
    from best practice (e.g., slightly loose permissions on internal dirs, lack
    of modern encryption on low-value internal transport) without a clear
    exploit path.

05. **`non_security_critical` (Non-Security Critical Components)** The finding
    affects a component or data with no security sensitivity (e.g., public info,
    signatures on non-security payloads, cosmetic outputs).

06. **`vague_code_paths` (Vague Code Paths / Fragile Assumptions)** Relying on
    unverified assumptions about caller behavior or adjacent system components.

    **Snapshot carve-out (STALE_EVIDENCE):** do NOT fire this rule when the
    finding is NOT_MATCHED to the active snapshot, or its `code_paths` file is
    absent under the pinned CODE_ROOT. "Caller behavior" re-checked against
    drifted callers is meaningless; keep the higher score and mark
    `calibration_checklist.vague_code_paths.outcome = "UNKNOWN"` with a
    `STALE_EVIDENCE:` reason. Also skip this rule for non-source LOCATOR
    findings.

07. **`unreliable_triggers` (Unreliable/Noisy Triggers)** Triggers that are
    likely to be ignored in practice or indistinguishable from normal
    operations.

08. **`prerequisite_shell` (Prerequisite Shell Access / Equivalent Primitives)**
    The attacker already possesses local shell access on the target container or
    host with the **same or higher** privilege level than the exploit provides,
    rendering the gained access redundant under the Principle of Marginal
    Capability (e.g., exploiting a bug to get a standard user shell when already
    logged in as a standard user, or exploiting a local buffer overflow to run
    commands as root when already running as root). This does NOT apply to
    low-to-high privilege escalation (e.g., standard user to root), which should
    cap at MEDIUM.

09. **`physical_long_term` (Physical Long-Term / Laboratory Access)** If the
    attack requires long-term physical access to the device or specialized
    laboratory equipment (e.g., fault injection, side-channel analysis, chip
    decapping). Force-downgrade to **LOW (2.0)** due to the extreme execution
    barrier and requirement for physical possession.

10. **`trusted_controller_zero_delta` (Trusted-Controller-Mediated Interface -
    Zero Delta)** If the vulnerable interface is reachable only from a component
    that holds designed-in authoritative control over the target (e.g.,
    orchestrator->worker, driver->device firmware, protocol master->slave,
    hypervisor->guest, management plane->data plane node), and the exploit
    grants **zero marginal capability** (i.e., the controller could already
    achieve the identical effect or level of compromise via its standard,
    legitimate interface), force-downgrade to **LOW (2.0)**. (This generalizes
    the *Standard Host-to-Guest Attacks* rule below).

11. **`standard_host_attacks` (Standard Host-to-Guest Attacks)** If the attacker
    position is `HOST_SYSTEM` (host hypervisor attacking guest) on standard
    deployments (non-Confidential Computing). Force-downgrade to **LOW (2.0)**
    as the host OS/hypervisor already possesses total control over the guest by
    design, meaning the exploit offers zero marginal capability over the
    prerequisite position (equivalent primitives). **Default assumption:** treat
    as non-Confidential Computing (this rule fires) UNLESS the Threat Model,
    code path, or finding description explicitly names Confidential Computing,
    guest enclaves, TEE, SEV, TDX, SGX, or attestation (in which case apply the
    CC Host Attacks cap-HIGH rule instead).

______________________________________________________________________

### Category B: Force-Cap to HIGH (Cap at 7.9 / Maximum HIGH Priority)

1. **`static_confirmation` (Static Confirmation)** Statically confirmed but not
   empirically reproduced (`repro_status: "statically_confirmed"`). Cap
   `likelihood_score` at **3**, apply **0.8** multiplier to Hazard, and MUST NOT
   be CRITICAL. *Exception:* If the finding details (description, history, or
   reproduction output) include a valid external stack trace, sanitizer trace
   (e.g. ASan, UBSan, MSan), crash log, or core dump proving the vulnerability
   was triggered in execution (e.g., in a prior run or by external tools), treat
   it as empirically reproduced (Likelihood 5) and do not apply this static cap.

   **Snapshot carve-out (STALE_EVIDENCE):** the trace-lift *Exception* above
   MUST NOT be applied when the finding is NOT_MATCHED to the active snapshot,
   or its `code_paths` file is absent under the pinned CODE_ROOT — a stack trace
   / ASan / crash-log captured on a prior snapshot may not correspond to the
   current code, so treating it as live reproduction would falsely inflate to
   CRITICAL. In that case KEEP the static HIGH cap in force and mark
   `calibration_checklist.static_confirmation.outcome = "APPLIES"` with a
   `STALE_EVIDENCE:` reason noting the trace-lift was suppressed. (The base
   static cap itself is driven by `repro_status: "statically_confirmed"` from
   the finding JSON and still applies normally.)

2. **`strict_xss` (Strict XSS Caps)** All XSS vulnerabilities. Default to MEDIUM
   or LOW; cap at HIGH (7.9) only for stored XSS on critical admin pages with
   zero-click execution for the admin.

3. **`internal_nested` (Internal / Nested Components)** Any finding with a
   Network/Trust Exposure multiplier less than 1.0 (i.e., Internal Component or
   Privileged Zone). If the calculated score lands in the CRITICAL range, cap
   the score at **7.9** and downgrade the priority to HIGH. *Exception:* Do NOT
   cap at HIGH if the component is core in-cluster infrastructure (e.g., CNI,
   CSI, admission webhook, service mesh) AND the impact escapes to the host node
   (e.g., node-root file R/W) or allows cross-tenant escalation. These remain
   eligible for CRITICAL. **This rule MUST NOT fire when the `attacker_position`
   is `"EXTERNAL"` (since per the alignment rule in Section 2, the exposure is
   forced to `EXPOSED` (1.0), which precludes this cap).**

4. **`probabilistic_llm` (Probabilistic LLM Vectors)** Attacks relying on
   probabilistic LLM behavior (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking) to trigger
   a vulnerability. Cap at **HIGH** (7.9) and default to **MEDIUM** or **LOW**.
   *Exception:* If the attacker can query the LLM/system repeatedly without rate
   limits, concurrency limits, or security blocking/alerting that would impede
   the attack (allowing them to brute-force and effectively eliminate the
   non-determinism), this cap may be lifted.

5. **`supply_chain_prerequisites` (Supply-Chain / Build-Time Prerequisites)** If
   the exploit requires the attacker to already possess a supply-chain position
   (e.g., ability to poison dependencies, modify upstream source) or write
   access to the build pipeline to trigger the vulnerability. Cap at **HIGH
   (7.9)** since the entry barrier is extremely high, but the downstream
   compromise is systemic. (Force-downgrade to LOW/2.0 only if they already
   possess shell access on the target, as per the Prerequisite Shell Access
   rule).

6. **`non_default_config` (Non-Default Configurations)** Findings that are only
   exploitable under non-default configurations. Cap at **HIGH (7.9)** to
   reflect the additional configuration barrier.

7. **`confidential_computing_host` (Confidential Computing Host Attacks)** If
   the attacker position is `HOST_SYSTEM` (the host OS or hypervisor attacking
   guest enclaves or confidential VMs) in Confidential Computing deployments.
   Cap at **HIGH (7.9)** because while the host has full control of the
   platform, confidential computing enclaves are designed to protect against
   host-level compromise. (If not a CC deployment, see the Standard
   Host-to-Guest Attacks rule under LOW).

8. **`trusted_controller_critical_bypass` (Trusted-Controller-Mediated Interface
   \- Critical Bypass)** If the vulnerable interface is reachable only from a
   designed-in authoritative controller, and the exploit allows that controller
   to bypass target-side **documented security controls** or **safety-of-life
   limits** it was designed to respect, cap at **HIGH (7.9)**. (If the exploit
   allows lateral reach into a different trust domain or achieves persistence
   surviving controller re-provisioning, do not cap).

______________________________________________________________________

### Category C: Force-Cap to MEDIUM (Cap at 5.9 / Maximum MEDIUM Priority)

1. **`local_attack_vector` (Local Attack Vector)** Vulnerabilities requiring
   local shell access (e.g., local privilege escalation, SUID exploitation)
   without VM escape. (Downgrade to LOW/2.0 if it only affects a single user's
   isolated data).

2. **`self_contained_blast` (Self-Contained Blast Radius)** If the maximum
   impact of the exploit is confined to resources, data, or execution contexts
   that the triggering principal already owns or has full designed-in authority
   over — their own account, tenant, project, namespace, container, VM, device,
   or single-user installation — and does not cross any isolation boundary
   between mutually-distrusting principals, cap at **MEDIUM (5.9)**.

   - The exploit may grant genuinely new capability within that domain (e.g.,
     API-user -> shell in their own container), but the deployment's core
     isolation guarantees to other parties still hold.
   - Do **NOT** apply this cap if the exploit:
     - reaches another principal's resources (cross-tenant, cross-user,
       cross-account),
     - touches shared or multi-party infrastructure (shared cache, shared
       filesystem, operator control plane, co-tenant side-channel),
     - places the attacker's domain upstream of others (build node, CI runner,
       package registry, model-serving host — i.e., a supply-chain position), or
     - persists in a way that survives the principal's own resource lifecycle
       and could later affect a different principal reusing that slot.

3. **`rarely_exposed` (Rarely Exposed Components)** Findings in components
   documented as 'rarely exposed' or 'unlikely to be user controlled'.

4. **`equivalent_primitives` (Equivalent Primitives - No Boundary Breach)** The
   attacker profile capable of triggering the vulnerability already possesses
   equivalent access, privileges, or capabilities (primitives) through standard
   system features (e.g., an admin exploiting a bug to download a file they can
   already download via the UI). Because this offers low marginal capability
   over their prerequisite position, cap at **MEDIUM (5.9)** to maintain
   visibility for defense-in-depth cleanup.

5. **`documented_insecure_config` (Documented Insecure Configurations)**
   Non-default configurations that are explicitly documented in public manuals
   as insecure, diagnostic-only, or strictly non-production. Cap at **MEDIUM
   (5.9)**.

6. **`physical_temporary` (Physical Temporary Access)** If the attack requires
   temporary physical access to the device (e.g., USB key insertion, evil maid
   attacks) without long-term laboratory analysis. Cap at **MEDIUM (5.9)**.

7. **`high_privilege_external` (High-Privilege External Access)** Exploits with
   `attacker_position: "EXTERNAL"` that require `privileges_required: "HIGH"`
   (e.g., admin RCE on public portals). Cap at **MEDIUM (5.9)**, unless the
   exploit results in escaping the container boundary (to host node) or
   cross-tenant escalation.

8. **`trusted_controller_standard_bypass` (Trusted-Controller-Mediated Interface
   \- Standard Bypass)** If the vulnerable interface is reachable only from a
   designed-in authoritative controller, and the exploit allows that controller
   to bypass target-side **standard safety or sanity limits** (but not critical
   safety-of-life or documented security controls) it was expected to respect,
   cap at **MEDIUM (5.9)**.
