# Risk Calibrator (/mantis-calibrate)

## System Goal

Risk Analysis Expert. Evaluates confirmed findings against a rigorous risk
matrix, taking into account successful reproduction and production viability to
produce a final risk score (1-10).

## Command Definition

- **Command:** `/mantis-calibrate`
- **Description:** Calibrates the risk level of findings based on evidence and
  impact.

## Input/Output Contract

- **Reads**:
  - `workspace/findings/*.json` (all finding files to load full pipeline state).
  - `workspace/kb/THREAT_MODEL.md` (if exists, to check threat boundary
    overrides and asset criticality).
  - `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (to track the current loop pass, and to read
    `active_snapshot` — `{snapshot_id, snapshot_pinned, root}` — for finding
    provenance and history stamping; absent ⇒ degraded/today's behavior).
- **Writes**:
  - Updates finding files in-place with scoring/calibration fields
    (`impact_score`, `likelihood_score`, `availability_tier`,
    `inferred_exposure`, `attacker_position`, `mantis_risk_score`, `priority`,
    `sanity_triage_applied` (may begin with `STALE_EVIDENCE` when the
    STALE-EVIDENCE guard suppresses heuristics), `calibration_checklist`
    (entries may carry `STALE_EVIDENCE:` reasons), `outrage_commentary`,
    `executive_summary`). Appends a `history` entry with `snapshot` provenance
    (see history JSON template in the body).
  - Reusable helper script `workspace/helpers/append_calibrate.py`.
- **Preconditions**:
  - Confirmed or raw findings must exist in `workspace/findings/`.
- **Idempotency Guarantee**:
  - Updates findings in place by overwriting existing keys with the calculated
    score. Running multiple times on the same inputs yields identical outputs,
    with no duplicated entries.

## Instructions

Convert the raw security findings and their empirical results (repro/patch) into
a prioritized, actionable risk report.

Execute the calibration as follows:

**Locator resolution (findings-only).** Calibrate never needs to read target
source to compute a score, but some heuristics below may re-inspect code;
resolve the code root the same way every stage does. **Block A** is inlined
below:

```
LOCATOR RESOLUTION (before reading ANY target code or artifact):
0. ROLE: If this skill NEVER reads target source (report, calibrate, reflect),
   you are a FINDINGS-ONLY stage: skip steps 2-6; still read active_snapshot from
   state for provenance/annotation; NEVER stop merely because a code root is unset.
1. Determine CODE_ROOT, in this priority order:
   a. If --target_root is passed on THIS invocation, CODE_ROOT = --target_root.
      It is AUTHORITATIVE and OVERRIDES SNAPSHOT_ROOT and the state fallback
      (used when a caller hands you a prepared tree, e.g. a patched shadow).
   b. Else if --snapshot_root (or SNAPSHOT_ROOT) is passed, use it.
   c. Else read state_root/workspace/.mantis_state.json (state_root from
      --state_root if passed, else ./workspace/... relative to the current dir)
      -> active_snapshot.root / .snapshot_id / .snapshot_pinned.
   d. Else (no arg AND no readable active_snapshot): CODE_ROOT = current directory,
      treat snapshot_pinned = false (MODE-OFF). Do NOT stop.
2. SENTINEL CHECK (only if snapshot_pinned is true AND you did NOT take path 1a):
   verify CODE_ROOT/.mantis_snapshot_id exists and equals SNAPSHOT_ID. If missing
   or different -> STOP "snapshot sentinel mismatch". (A --target_root tree (1a) is
   deliberately mutated and is sentinel-EXEMPT.)
3. PATH FIELDS:
   - SNAPSHOT-RELATIVE (read under CODE_ROOT): code_paths entries; plan target_files
     that are file paths. Strip ONLY a trailing ":<digits>". A code_paths entry
     containing "://" is a URL/endpoint, NOT a file read. A code_paths entry that is
     NOT of the form <existing-path>:<integer> is a non-source LOCATOR
     (symbol/offset/endpoint): only check that the artifact/symbol exists; skip ALL
     line-range and line-existence logic.
   - STATE-RELATIVE (read/write under state_root/workspace, NEVER prefix CODE_ROOT):
     kb_references, repro_file_path, reattack_file_path, helper scripts, report
     files, and all state/findings JSON.
4. Never WRITE under CODE_ROOT when snapshot_pinned is true. Any command that
   compiles, generates, or writes artifacts MUST run in a PRIVATE SHADOW copy
   (mktemp -d from CODE_ROOT), never with cwd=CODE_ROOT. Read-only inspection may
   cd into CODE_ROOT.
5. VCS-METADATA CARVE-OUT: history-log extraction and any VCS diff/blame command
   run in the LIVE repository root (which still has .git/.hg/.repo), NOT CODE_ROOT
   (the snapshot copy strips VCS metadata). Do NOT stop merely because CODE_ROOT
   lacks .git/.hg/.repo.
6. Every shell command uses ABSOLUTE paths and sets its own working directory on
   that call. Do NOT assume the working directory persists between calls.
```

> [!NOTE] **CURRENT-PASS CHECK (defensive; the binding guarantee is on the
> harness per `mantis-pipeline-adapter` Scenario 2):** if `active_snapshot` is
> present AND `active_snapshot.pass != state.pass_number`, treat the snapshot as
> STALE for this pass — STOP "stale active_snapshot: pass mismatch" or degrade
> as HALT (`snapshot_pinned` effectively false: no authoritative verdicts, Block

> `pass`-aware).

**Snapshot provenance & STALE-EVIDENCE guard (mechanical; do this before
scoring):**

P0. Read `active_snapshot` (`{snapshot_id, snapshot_pinned, root}`) from
`state_root/workspace/.mantis_state.json` (Block A step 0/1c). NEVER stop if it
is absent — calibrate is a FINDINGS-ONLY stage (Block A step 0).

P1. MODE (single decision for the whole run — branches on `active_snapshot`
presence, 3-state model): - `active_snapshot` is ABSENT in state (no `--sync`
was requested — MODE-OFF = today's default) -> MODE = MODE-OFF. Score **exactly
as today**: run every heuristic as written, do NOT compute PROVENANCE, do NOT
emit `STALE_EVIDENCE`, and do NOT emit any HALT/PINNED banners.
(Backward-compatible default path — byte-for-byte today's behavior.) -
`active_snapshot` IS present AND `snapshot_pinned` is not exactly `true` (HALT
mode — the tree raced or could not be pinned) -> MODE = HALT. `SNAPSHOT_ID` =
`active_snapshot.snapshot_id` (a `live:` id). Compute PROVENANCE per P2 below
and fire the STALE-EVIDENCE guard conservatively (same as PINNED for guard
purposes), because findings' locators may be stale. Authoritative verdicts
(VERIFIED_SECURE, failed_to_reproduce, DUPLICATE, FALSE_POSITIVE, NON_VIABLE)
are forbidden this pass. - `snapshot_pinned` == `true` -> MODE = PINNED.
`SNAPSHOT_ID` = `active_snapshot.snapshot_id`. Full provenance + STALE-EVIDENCE
guard as below.

P2. In MODE = PINNED or HALT, compute PROVENANCE per finding F using Block B's
compare rule: - `F.discovery_commit` missing OR empty OR the literal `"MIXED"`
-> NOT_MATCHED. - `F.discovery_commit` != `SNAPSHOT_ID` (exact string compare,
no fuzzy) -> NOT_MATCHED. - `F.discovery_commit` == `SNAPSHOT_ID` -> MATCHED.

P3. A per-finding heuristic is **STALE** for F when MODE is PINNED OR HALT AND
either: - PROVENANCE(F) == NOT_MATCHED, OR - the finding's `code_paths` target
file does NOT exist under CODE_ROOT. (Resolve CODE_ROOT via Block A steps 1 & 3;
strip a trailing `:<digits>`; read ONLY the pinned root, NEVER the live tree. If
you cannot resolve CODE_ROOT at all, treat the file as absent -> STALE.)

P4. When a heuristic is STALE for F, do NOT apply it; keep the **conservative**
(pre-adjustment) score; and ensure the literal token `STALE_EVIDENCE` is the
FIRST token of `sanity_triage_applied` (add it once, before any UNKNOWN warnings
and any fired-rule list). The four guarded heuristics and their exact STALE
handling are: - **Dead-code 0.2 multiplier** (Section 2, "Asset Criticality &
Reachability"): do NOT apply the 0.2 reduction; use the multiplier you would
otherwise have. - **`repro_failure`** (Section 3 rule): do NOT force-LOW; set
`calibration_checklist.repro_failure.outcome = "UNKNOWN"`, `reason` beginning
`"STALE_EVIDENCE: "`. - **`vague_code_paths`** (Section 3 rule): do NOT
force-LOW; set `calibration_checklist.vague_code_paths.outcome = "UNKNOWN"`,
`reason` beginning `"STALE_EVIDENCE: "`. - **`static_confirmation` trace-lift**
(Section 3 rule, its "valid external stack trace/sanitizer…" exception): do NOT
apply the trace-lift; KEEP the static HIGH cap in force (`likelihood_score` \<=
3, 0.8 Hazard multiplier, NOT CRITICAL). Set
`calibration_checklist.static_confirmation.outcome = "APPLIES"`, `reason`
beginning
`"STALE_EVIDENCE: trace-lift suppressed; trace/crash-log may predate the active snapshot; "`.

P5. NON-SOURCE finding: if the finding's `code_paths` entry is a non-source
LOCATOR (contains `"://"`, or is not of the form `<path>:<integer>` — per Block
A step 3: a symbol / offset / endpoint), SKIP all source-only heuristics for it
— dead-code, file-path/imports/caller-hierarchy exposure inference,
`vague_code_paths`, and static trace re-inspection — and score from the
finding's DECLARED metadata (`attacker_position`, `privileges_required`,
`production_viability`, `repro_status`, threat model). A non-source skip is NOT
flagged `STALE_EVIDENCE` (it is normal, not drift). Non-source findings default
`inferred_exposure` to `"INTERNAL"` (0.8) unless the finding/threat-model
declares otherwise.

1. **Load Full Pipeline State:**

   - Read all JSON files from the `workspace/findings/` directory. Because the
     pipeline appends data to each finding file at each stage, these files
     provide the complete picture of each finding's journey (including its `id`,
     reproduction status, and production viability).
   - **Missing Fields Fallbacks:** If any finding is missing viability, or
     reproduction fields (such as chained findings), apply the following
     fallback defaults before scoring:
     - If `production_viability` is missing, treat it as `"CONDITIONAL_VIABLE"`.
     - If `repro_status` is missing, treat it as `"not_attempted"`.
   - **Snapshot provenance (only when MODE is PINNED or HALT):** for each
     finding, compute PROVENANCE (MATCHED / NOT_MATCHED) per preamble step P2
     and record it in scratch. This value gates the STALE-EVIDENCE handling in
     Sections 2 and 3 (preamble steps P3–P4). In MODE == MODE-OFF, skip this —
     score as today.
   - Read `workspace/kb/THREAT_MODEL.md` from the Knowledge Base (if it exists)
     to evaluate component exposure, trust boundaries, asset criticality, and
     any custom **Calibration Overrides** (e.g., specific threat positions or
     caps that should be lifted or customized for the project).
   - **Batch Processing:** If there are more than a few findings to calibrate,
     split the task into batches (a few findings at a time). If you have the
     ability to invoke subagents, delegate each batch to a subagent to process
     in parallel, then aggregate the results. **Each batch/subagent inspects
     ONLY the pinned snapshot:** pass `--snapshot_root=<active_snapshot.root>`,
     `--snapshot_id=<active_snapshot.snapshot_id>`, and
     `--state_root=<workspace parent>` so every subagent resolves the same
     CODE_ROOT via Block A. Any code inspection a batch performs (exposure
     inference, dead-code, static-trace verification) MUST read through that
     CODE_ROOT (the pinned copy), NEVER the live tree, and MUST honor the
     STALE-EVIDENCE guard (preamble P3–P4). Findings-only fields (score,
     priority, history stamp) are computed from the finding JSON regardless.

2. **Calculate Risk Score (1-10):** For each unique finding file, calculate the
   actual technical risk score in a matrix form based on the following formula
   components, where **Hazard = Impact + Likelihood**:

   - **Impact (1-5):** Evaluate impact using the CIA triad (Confidentiality,
     Integrity, Availability) while strictly considering **Blast Radius**.
     - 5: Complete, systemic loss of Confidentiality (full data breach, leak of
       root cryptographic/HSM master keys) or Integrity (system compromise,
       e.g., clear Remote Code Execution (RCE) by an unprivileged attacker who
       isn't already in an effective position to execute code). MUST NOT be used
       for attackers who already have execution privileges.
     - 4: Substantial loss in one or more areas. This includes systemic
       Availability loss (total outage of a major service) or major data
       exposure.
     - 3: Moderate loss (e.g., partial data exposure, temporary or partial
       system disruption).
     - 2: Minor loss (e.g., minor information leak, localized disruption). A
       vulnerability whose blast radius is limited to affecting *only a single
       user's own data* MUST NOT be scored higher than 2. *Exception:* If the
       action lacks non-repudiation (allowing the user to plausibly deny the
       action to commit fraud or blame others), or triggers side-effects
       affecting other users/system stability, it should not be downgraded.
     - 1: Negligible impact on CIA, mostly a cosmetic issue. Findings of the
       type "the code is fragile", "lack of defense-in-depth", or purely
       theoretical hygiene issues MUST have an Impact score of 1, ensuring they
       are rated LOW at most.
     - **Security Control Bypass (Upgrading):** If the vulnerability directly
       bypasses a core security control (e.g., authentication, authorization,
       cryptographic signature verification) or defeats the primary security
       purpose of a library (e.g., a library meant to secure keysets allows
       attacker control), elevate the Impact score to at least **4** (or **5**
       if it leads to systemic compromise), even if the immediate technical
       impact seems localized.
     - *Note on Privileges Required & Lateral Movement:*
       - If the finding requires **HIGH** privileges (e.g., administrative
         privileges, admin-to-super-admin escalation) or only allows lateral
         movement/pivoting between internal components from an already
         compromised state, cap its individual Impact score at **2**, unless the
         exploit results in escaping the container boundary (to the host node)
         or cross-tenant escalation.
       - If the finding requires **LOW** privileges (e.g., standard
         authenticated user), cap its individual Impact score at **3** (unless
         it leads to systemic compromise of other tenants/users, OR it directly
         bypasses a core security control/library purpose, in which case it can
         be higher).
       - These caps apply to *individual* findings. If successfully chained into
         an Exploit Chain (Super Finding) by the chainer, the chain itself
         should be evaluated based on the privilege level required for the
         *entry point* (initial step) of the chain.
   - **Likelihood (1-5):** Evaluate the probability of occurrence based on
     proven exploitability rather than theoretical difficulty.
     - 5: Actively exploited in the wild, OR the agent successfully generated a
       functional, weaponized exploit (not just a unit test).
     - 4: Public Proof of Concept (PoC) exists, OR the agent generated a highly
       plausible but partially weaponized exploit.
     - 3: No functional exploit, but the attack vector is trivial to automate.
     - 2: Theoretical and highly complex (requires local access, strict timing).
     - 1: Strictly theoretical risk with no known exploit path.
     - **Reachability-in-Practice Modifier:** After determining the base
       likelihood, reduce the `likelihood_score` by **1 or 2** (but not below
       1.0) if the exploit path relies on uncommon or non-default usage
       patterns. This applies if:
       - The specific tainted parameter is populated from attacker input only
         during rare API calls, uncommon configuration fields, or in data
         formats rarely processed in the wild.
       - The vulnerability requires non-standard or administrative-only
         configurations that are rarely enabled in practice.
   - **Context Multiplier (0.1 - 1.0):**
     - If `status` is **FALSE_POSITIVE** or **NEEDS_RESEARCH**, or if
       `production_viability` is **NON_VIABLE**: Drop this finding completely.
       Do not score it or update its file with calibration data.
     - If `production_viability` is **VIABLE**, **CONDITIONAL_VIABLE**, or
       **SAMPLE_OR_TEST**:
       - **Network/Trust Exposure:**
         - If the finding resides inside an **Exposed Interface / Trust
           Boundary** (directly accessible to untrusted inputs): 1.0.
         - If it resides in an **Internal Component** accepting semi-trusted
           parsed data: 0.8.
         - If deeply nested inside a **Privileged/Trusted Zone**: 0.5.
         - **Inference when Threat Model is Missing/Incomplete:** If
           `workspace/kb/THREAT_MODEL.md` does not exist or does not mention the
           component:
           - Analyze the file path, imports, and caller hierarchy to infer
             exposure (e.g., public APIs vs internal helpers). **Read only the
             pinned CODE_ROOT (Block A), never the live tree. NON-SOURCE
             (preamble P5): skip this file-path/imports/caller analysis for
             non-source LOCATOR findings — default `inferred_exposure` to
             `"INTERNAL"` (0.8) unless the finding or threat model declares
             otherwise.** When MODE is PINNED or HALT and the finding is
             NOT_MATCHED or its `code_paths` file is absent under CODE_ROOT, do
             NOT lower the exposure multiplier below the declared/default value
             on the basis of live re-inspection (keep the conservative, higher
             multiplier).
           - Default the Exposure Multiplier to **0.8** (Internal) and
             `inferred_exposure` to `"INTERNAL"` unless there is clear evidence
             of direct external exposure (EXPOSED) or deep nested isolation
             (PRIVILEGED). Local SUID/LPE binaries should default to
             `"INTERNAL"` exposure.
           - If the finding description, history, or critic reasoning suggests
             the component is "rarely exposed", "internal only", or "unlikely to
             be attacker-reachable", reduce the Exposure Multiplier to **0.5**
             or lower.
       - **Map Exposure and Attacker Position Metadata:**
         - Resolve **`inferred_exposure`** based on the Network/Trust Exposure
           multiplier:
           - Multiplier 1.0 (Exposed Interface) -> `"EXPOSED"`
           - Multiplier 0.8 (Internal Component) -> `"INTERNAL"`
           - Multiplier 0.5 (Privileged/Trusted Zone) -> `"PRIVILEGED"`
         - **Evaluate Attacker Position (declared in finding):**
           - Read `attacker_position` from the finding JSON.
           - **Determine by Barrier, Not Transport:** The `attacker_position`
             must represent the outermost boundary that the **first untrusted
             principal** (the ultimate human attacker or external threat actor)
             must cross to reach the interface. Do not key on the transport
             protocol (e.g., HTTP, gRPC, IPC) or the immediate protocol peer.
             - **Trace Back to Untrusted Actor:** If the immediate peer
               interacting with the interface is a trusted-by-design component
               (e.g., an internal proxy, gateway, message queue, or master
               controller), you must trace back the data flow to find the
               outermost boundary where the untrusted actor first enters the
               system.
             - If the interface is bound to `localhost` or uses local IPC (unix
               sockets, pipes, shared memory), the position is `"LOCAL"`, even
               if it uses HTTP/TCP under the hood.
             - If the interface is only reachable within a private network (VPC,
               corporate network, home LAN, local network, internal cluster
               control plane), the position is `"INTERNAL_NETWORK"` (or
               `"IN_CLUSTER"` if restricted to pod-to-pod), even if it is a web
               service.
             - The position is only `"EXTERNAL"` if the interface is directly
               reachable from the public internet.
             - If the interface requires physical contact, hardware interaction
               (e.g., JTAG, debug probes, chip decapping), or local wireless
               proximity (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth), the position must be
               `"PHYSICAL_TEMPORARY"` or `"PHYSICAL_LONG_TERM"`, regardless of
               the protocol used.
           - **Normalize Free-text:** If the value is present but is a free-text
             string that does not exactly match one of the valid enum values
             (e.g. legacy phrasings), you **MUST** normalize it to the closest
             valid enum using these mappings:
             - Phrases matching `"authenticated <role>"`, `"customer with"`,
               `"tenant <role>"`, `"Fitbit user"` on a public product ->
               `"EXTERNAL"` (with `privileges_required: "LOW"`).
             - Phrases matching `"local user"`, `"local shell"`,
               `"local access"` -> `"LOCAL"`.
             - Phrases matching `"peer <role> in same job/cluster/pod"`,
               `"co-tenant"`,
               `"in-cluster (Kubernetes/container-orchestrator) workload"`,
               `"NCCL peer rank"` -> `"IN_CLUSTER"`.
             - Phrases matching `"malicious dependency"`, `"upstream package"`,
               `"build-time"`, `"CI pipeline"` -> `"SUPPLY_CHAIN"`.
             - Phrases matching `"host hypervisor"`, `"host OS"`,
               `"hypervisor access"` -> `"HOST_SYSTEM"`.
             - Phrases matching `"physical access"`, `"fault injection"` ->
               `"PHYSICAL_LONG_TERM"` or `"PHYSICAL_TEMPORARY"` based on
               barrier.
           - If missing altogether, infer it using the following fallback
             guidelines (and log a warning to suggest declaring it earlier):
             - `"EXTERNAL"`: If the component is `"EXPOSED"`, or it's an auth
               bypass on a public portal.
             - `"LOCAL"`: If it's a local privilege escalation (LPE) or SUID
               exploit.
             - `"IN_CLUSTER"`: If it targets in-cluster infrastructure (CSI/CNI)
               from a pod.
             - `"HOST_SYSTEM"`: If the attacker is the hypervisor, host OS, or
               an emulated/physical device attacking software it hosts (guest
               driver, enclave runtime, firmware target). This enum is strictly
               for the outer-to-inner direction. The reverse direction —
               guest-to-host (VM escape), sandbox-to-outside, enclave-to-host,
               or contained-process-to-container — must be classified as
               `"LOCAL"` (or `"IN_CLUSTER"` for Kubernetes pod-to-node; a
               KVM/hypervisor guest attacking its host is "LOCAL"), never
               `"HOST_SYSTEM"`.
             - `"PHYSICAL_LONG_TERM"` / `"PHYSICAL_TEMPORARY"`: If the bug
               description, title, or code path indicates hardware fault
               injection, side-channel, evil maid, or USB physical access.
             - `"SUPPLY_CHAIN"`: For build-time or dependency modification
               prerequisites.
             - `"INTERNAL_NETWORK"`: Default fallback for other internal
               components.
           - **Align Exposure with Position:**
             - If the `attacker_position` is `"LOCAL"` or `"IN_CLUSTER"`, you
               **MUST** resolve `inferred_exposure` to `"INTERNAL"` (using 0.8
               multiplier) even if the vulnerable code path resides in a folder
               mapped to `"EXPOSED"` in the Threat Model, unless the exploit
               explicitly escapes the container boundary to the host node.
             - If the `attacker_position` is `"INTERNAL_NETWORK"`, you **MUST**
               resolve `inferred_exposure` to at most `"INTERNAL"` (using 0.8
               multiplier or lower) even if the component is mapped to
               `"EXPOSED"` in the Threat Model, as the interface is not directly
               reachable from the public internet.
             - If the `attacker_position` is `"EXTERNAL"`, you **MUST** resolve
               `inferred_exposure` to `"EXPOSED"` (using 1.0 multiplier) even if
               the component is mapped to `"INTERNAL"` or `"PRIVILEGED"` in the
               Threat Model (reflecting that untrusted external inputs reach the
               component).
       - **Asset Criticality & Reachability:**
         - If the Threat Model indicates the component handles high-value data
           (e.g., PII, core secrets), keep the multiplier high.
         - If it affects a low-value target (e.g., internal analytics, sandboxed
           test data), reduce the multiplier (e.g., 0.5).
         - **Availability-Specific Context:** If the finding is
           availability-only (DoS), check the component's `availability_tier` in
           the Threat Model (if missing, default to STANDARD):
           - `LOW_CRITICALITY`: Reduce multiplier to **0.5**.
           - `STANDARD`: Reduce multiplier to **0.8**.
           - `CRITICAL`: Keep multiplier at **1.0**.
         - If static/dynamic analysis proves the vulnerable code is effectively
           "dead code" (never called in runtime execution paths), drastically
           reduce the multiplier to 0.2. **STALE-EVIDENCE GUARD (preamble
           P3–P4): do NOT apply this 0.2 reduction if the finding is STALE (MODE
           is PINNED or HALT AND the finding is NOT_MATCHED to the active
           snapshot, `code_paths` file is absent under the pinned CODE_ROOT) —
           drifted code can look "uncalled" spuriously; keep the higher
           multiplier and set `STALE_EVIDENCE` as the first token of
           `sanity_triage_applied`.** Any dead-code analysis you do run MUST
           inspect the pinned CODE_ROOT, never the live tree. **NON-SOURCE
           (preamble P5):** skip this heuristic entirely for non-source LOCATOR
           findings.
       - **User Interaction:**
         - If `user_interaction` is **REQUIRED** (e.g., CSRF, Clickjacking, or
           convincing a user to open a malicious file), apply a **0.7**
           multiplier to the Context Multiplier (e.g., if exposure is Internal
           (0.8) and user interaction is required, the combined multiplier is
           0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56). This ensures these findings are capped below the
           CRITICAL threshold.
     - If `production_viability` is **SAMPLE_OR_TEST**:
       - Apply a **0.4** scaling factor to the Context Multiplier (i.e.,
         multiply the current Context Multiplier by **0.4**) so that severe bugs
         in sample code typically land in the MEDIUM bucket rather than HIGH or
         CRITICAL. This scaling factor must be applied cumulatively alongside
         other modifiers. Do not override the Context Multiplier directly to
         `0.4`, as this would incorrectly increase it if the component's
         exposure or dead-code status was already calculated to be lower than
         `0.4` (e.g. `0.2`).
       - In the `executive_summary`, explicitly state that this is not a
         production bug. The recommendation MUST focus on fixing the
         example/test so that developers do not copy insecure patterns into
         production code.
     - If `production_viability` is **CONDITIONAL_VIABLE**:
       - Apply a **0.7** scaling factor to the Context Multiplier (i.e.,
         multiply the current Context Multiplier by **0.7**) to reflect that it
         requires specific non-default configurations, compiler flags, or
         assertions enabled to be exploitable. This scaling factor must be
         applied cumulatively alongside other modifiers (such as User
         Interaction). Do not override the Context Multiplier directly to `0.7`,
         as this would incorrectly increase it if the component's exposure was
         already deep/isolated (`0.5`).
       - In the `executive_summary`, document the specific conditions required
         for viability.

   **Final Score (Hazard) = (Impact + Likelihood) * Multiplier** (Capped at
   10.0).

   *Note on Outrage:* In your reasoning, comment on the broader equation **Risk
   = Hazard + Outrage**, where the "outrage risk" (e.g., reputational damage,
   user sentiment fallout) is taken into account. Do *not* include the outrage
   factor in the final numerical score.

3. **Critical Sanity Triage (Downgrading & Capping Findings):** Before
   determining the final priority, perform a second-level sanity check on the
   quality of the finding, its context, and accumulated evidence.

   **Core Principle - Marginal Capability:** The final severity and priority of
   a finding are strictly bounded by the *marginal capability* gained by the
   attacker over their prerequisite position. If the exploit does not grant the
   attacker significant new control, access, or capabilities beyond what is
   already inherent to their starting position (or already possessed via
   legitimate means), the finding must be capped or downgraded.

   The complete, detailed definitions of the 27 calibration sanity rules are
   stored in the reference catalogue at
   [Calibration Rules](references/calibration_rules.md). You MUST evaluate each
   finding against the 27 rules listed there.

   Check if the `THREAT_MODEL.md` defines any `Calibration Overrides` (e.g.,
   `LIFT_CAP: PHYSICAL_LONG_TERM`). If an override exists for a finding's
   position or component, it takes precedence and lifts the corresponding cap.
   Otherwise, the caps and downgrades specified in the reference catalogue (and
   general applications of the Marginal Capability principle) override any
   upgrades calculated in Section 2 (including the Security Control Bypass
   upgrade). You should also apply the general principle to cap or downgrade
   other findings that offer low marginal capability. **Important: A cap (HIGH
   or MEDIUM) only limits the maximum allowed score/priority. It must NOT
   upgrade a lower score/priority (e.g., a finding with a score of 5.0 is
   naturally MEDIUM and must remain MEDIUM, even if it is subject to a cap at
   HIGH).**

   **Precedence & UNKNOWN Rules Policy:**

   - **STALE-EVIDENCE precedence (preamble P3–P4):** when MODE is PINNED or HALT
     and a finding is STALE (NOT_MATCHED to the active snapshot, OR its
     `code_paths` file is absent under the pinned CODE_ROOT), the following
     rules MUST NOT be used to lower or inflate the score from live
     re-inspection: `repro_failure` (do not force-LOW), `vague_code_paths` (do
     not force-LOW), and the `static_confirmation` **trace-lift exception** (do
     not treat a stale trace/sanitizer/crash-log as live reproduction — KEEP the
     static HIGH cap). Also do not apply the Section 2 dead-code 0.2 multiplier
     (see Section 2). Keep the conservative score and **prepend the literal
     token `STALE_EVIDENCE` as the FIRST token of `sanity_triage_applied`**
     (before any `Incomplete Calibration (UNKNOWN: …)` warnings and before the
     fired-rule list). Record the guarded rules in `calibration_checklist` as
     specified in preamble P4 (`repro_failure`/`vague_code_paths` -> `UNKNOWN`
     with a `STALE_EVIDENCE:` reason; `static_confirmation` -> `APPLIES` with a
     `STALE_EVIDENCE:` reason noting the trace-lift was suppressed). In MODE ==
     MODE-OFF, this bullet does nothing (score as today).
   - Evaluate ALL rules. If multiple caps apply, the **most restrictive** wins
     (Force-LOW > cap-MEDIUM > cap-HIGH).
   - **Policy for UNKNOWN outcomes:** If a rule is evaluated as `UNKNOWN`, do
     **not** apply the cap or downgrade (be score-conservative; keep the
     score/priority at their higher calculated values). However, mark the
     overall calibration as incomplete/provisional by prepending a warning to
     the `"sanity_triage_applied"` string:
     `"Incomplete Calibration (UNKNOWN: <rule_name>)"` (or a semicolon-separated
     list of warnings if there are multiple UNKNOWNs). This signals that manual
     review is required to resolve the rule status.
   - Record every rule that successfully fired/applied in
     `sanity_triage_applied` as a semicolon-separated list, most restrictive
     first (e.g., `"Local Attack Vector; Internal/Nested"`), appended after any
     UNKNOWN warnings if present, so the effective cap remains fully auditable.

4. **Determine Priority:**

   - **CRITICAL (8.0 - 10.0):** Immediate action required. Very high hazard
     (e.g. high impact and likelihood). **Must NOT be used unless it represents
     a clear RCE (or equivalent total loss) by an unprivileged attacker (where
     `privileges_required` is **NONE**) who is not already in an effective
     position to compromise the system, AND `user_interaction` is **NONE**
     (zero-click). This rule is absolute: even if a finding (like a CSI host
     escape) has its Section 3 caps lifted, if it requires HIGH privileges at
     entry, it MUST NOT be rated CRITICAL and must be capped at HIGH (7.9).
     Availability-only findings (DoS) MUST NOT be rated CRITICAL unless the
     `availability_tier` is explicitly documented as `CRITICAL` in the Threat
     Model AND no automatic recovery mechanism (e.g. auto-restart, load balancer
     failover) mitigates the impact.**
   - **HIGH (6.0 - 7.9):** High priority. Significant hazard, needs prompt
     resolution.
   - **MEDIUM (3.0 - 5.9):** Standard priority. Moderate hazard, can be
     scheduled.
   - **LOW (0.1 - 2.9):** Low priority. Minimal hazard. **Any finding of the
     type "the code is fragile", purely hygiene/defense-in-depth, or one that
     exclusively affects a single user's own data MUST be capped at LOW priority
     regardless of the calculated score (unless the exception for lack of
     non-repudiation or broader side-effects applies).**

5. **Token-Optimized File Updates:** To minimize LLM output tokens, **do not
   re-emit or manually rewrite the entire JSON object in your output.** Instead,
   write a reusable helper script (e.g.,
   `workspace/helpers/append_calibrate.py`) during your first finding update.
   For all subsequent findings, do not regenerate the script; simply execute the
   existing helper script with the new parameters to append the required fields
   to `workspace/findings/<id>.json`.

   - **Helper version marker (mandatory).** The very first line of
     `append_calibrate.py` MUST be the exact comment
     `# MANTIS_HELPER_VERSION = 2`. Before reusing an existing helper, read its
     first line: if the file is absent, OR the first line is not exactly
     `# MANTIS_HELPER_VERSION = 2` (marker missing or a different integer),
     **regenerate the helper from scratch** (an older helper silently drops the
     new `snapshot` history field and the `STALE_EVIDENCE` handling). The
     regenerated helper MUST be able to write the `snapshot` key into the
     appended `history` entry and to prepend `STALE_EVIDENCE` to
     `sanity_triage_applied`. The helper is STATE-RELATIVE
     (`workspace/helpers/…`, Block A step 3) — never write it under CODE_ROOT.

   Alongside the existing core finding data, explicitly append the following
   fields to show the matrix breakdown:

   - `"impact_score"` (1-5)

   - `"likelihood_score"` (1-5)

   - `"availability_tier"` (CRITICAL, STANDARD, LOW_CRITICALITY or null)

   - `"inferred_exposure"` (EXPOSED, INTERNAL, or PRIVILEGED)

   - `"attacker_position"` (preserved from input, or populated from fallback
     inference if missing)

   - `"mantis_risk_score"` (the final Hazard score)

   - `"priority"` (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

   - `"sanity_triage_applied"` (semicolon-separated list, or null). Ordering:
     `STALE_EVIDENCE` first if the finding was STALE (preamble P4); then any
     `Incomplete Calibration (UNKNOWN: <rule>)` warnings; then the Section 3
     rules that fired, most-restrictive first. Example:
     `"STALE_EVIDENCE; Incomplete Calibration (UNKNOWN: physical_long_term); Local Attack Vector"`.

   - `"calibration_checklist"` object containing evaluations for all 27 sanity
     caps. Each key in the object maps to the sanity cap rule of the matching
     name:

     }
     ```

     For each rule, `outcome` must be set to:

     - `"APPLIES"`: if the sanity cap rule applies (fires) to this finding,
       capping or downgrading its score/priority. A detailed `reason` string is
       **required**.
     - `"DOES_NOT_APPLY"`: if the sanity cap rule does not apply. The `reason`
       field is **optional** and may be omitted to optimize tokens.
     - `"UNKNOWN"`: if it is unresolved. A detailed `reason` string is
       **required**.

     For backward compatibility, the schema also permits `"fires": <bool>` (with
     `reason` required only if `fires` is `true`), but the new `"outcome"`
     format is preferred.

   - `"outrage_commentary"` (your reasoning about the outrage factor)

   - `"executive_summary"`

   - An entry to the `"history"` array:

     ```json
     {
       "stage": "calibrate",
       "action": "calibrated",
       "details": "Calculated risk score as [score] and priority as [priority].[ STALE_EVIDENCE: scored without trusting live-code re-inspection.]",
       "pass_number": <current_pass_number>,
       "snapshot": "<active_snapshot.snapshot_id, or omit in MODE-OFF>",
       "timestamp": "<current_iso8601_timestamp>"
     }
     ```
