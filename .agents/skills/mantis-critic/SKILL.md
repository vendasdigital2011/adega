# Critic (/mantis-critic)

## System Goal

Production Viability Expert. Filters validated security findings to confirm if
they remain triggerable in standard release and production configurations.

## Command Definition

- **Command:**
  `/mantis-critic [--target_root=<path>] [--snapshot_root=<path>] [--snapshot_id=<id>] [--state_root=<path>]`
- **Description:** Assesses the production viability of findings, filtering out
  debug-only features and assertion traps.
- **Parameters:**
  - `--target_root`: AUTHORITATIVE path to the target codebase root. Overrides
    all other locator sources and is sentinel-exempt (Block A path 1a). Defaults
    to unset.
  - `--snapshot_root`: Path to the pinned, immutable snapshot copy for this pass
    (a.k.a. `SNAPSHOT_ROOT`). Used as CODE_ROOT when `--target_root` is unset
    (Block A path 1b).
  - `--snapshot_id`: The `SNAPSHOT_ID` the orchestrator computed for this pass.
    Used for the Block A sentinel check and for the per-finding Block B drift
    comparison in Step 3. If omitted, fall back to `active_snapshot.snapshot_id`
    from state.
  - `--state_root`: Path to the root of the Mantis state directory containing
    `workspace/` (defaults to `.`). Every `workspace/...` path in this file is
    resolved relative to `--state_root`; with the default `.` this is identical
    to today's `workspace/`.

## Input/Output Contract

- **Reads**:
  - `workspace/findings/` (loads all findings regardless of status; also reads
    each finding's optional `discovery_commit` for the per-finding snapshot
    match check).
  - `workspace/kb/THREAT_MODEL.md` (if exists, to check deployment intent and
    the KB's recorded `kb_snapshot_id`).
  - `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (to track current loop pass and to read
    `active_snapshot.{root,snapshot_id,snapshot_pinned}` for locator resolution
    and provenance).
  - Target source code files under the resolved CODE_ROOT (the pinned snapshot
    root when `snapshot_pinned`), at paths/lines in `code_paths` with contextual
    offset.
- **Writes**:
  - Updates findings in-place (sets `"production_viability"`,
    `"critic_reasoning"`, and appends history).
  - Appends to `workspace/learnings.jsonl`.
- **Preconditions**:
  - Findings must exist in `workspace/findings/`.
- **Idempotency Guarantee**:
  - Overwrites viability fields in place. It must check if a critic entry for
    the current pass is already recorded in the history array, and check
    `workspace/learnings.jsonl` to ensure it does not write duplicate records if
    run again on the same input.

## Instructions

Evaluate validated findings to determine if they represent actionable security
flaws in a compiled, optimized release build. **Adopt a highly skeptical,
adversarial stance. Do not trust the reasoning of previous stages. Re-verify the
code path independently to definitively prove or disprove production
viability.**

### Locator Resolution (do this first)

Critic is a CODE-READING stage (it inspects the target source), so it is NOT a
findings-only stage: run all of Block A. Resolve CODE_ROOT and the sentinel per
Block A before loading findings.

```
LOCATOR RESOLUTION (before reading ANY target code or artifact):
0. ROLE: If this skill NEVER reads target source (report, calibrate, reflect),
   you are a FINDINGS-ONLY stage: skip steps 2-6; still read active_snapshot from
   state for provenance/annotation; NEVER stop merely because a code root is unset.
1. Determine CODE_ROOT, in this priority order:
   a. If --target_root is passed on THIS invocation, CODE_ROOT = --target_root.
      It is AUTHORITATIVE and OVERRIDES SNAPSHOT_ROOT and the state fallback
      (used when a caller hands you a prepared tree, e.g. a patched shadow).
   b. Else if --snapshot_root (or SNAPSHOT_ROOT) is passed, use it.
   c. Else read state_root/workspace/.mantis_state.json (state_root from
      --state_root if passed, else ./workspace/... relative to the current dir)
      -> active_snapshot.root / .snapshot_id / .snapshot_pinned.
   d. Else (no arg AND no readable active_snapshot): CODE_ROOT = current directory,
      treat snapshot_pinned = false (MODE-OFF). Do NOT stop.
2. SENTINEL CHECK (only if snapshot_pinned is true AND you did NOT take path 1a):
   verify CODE_ROOT/.mantis_snapshot_id exists and equals SNAPSHOT_ID. If missing
   or different -> STOP "snapshot sentinel mismatch". (A --target_root tree (1a) is
   deliberately mutated and is sentinel-EXEMPT.)
3. PATH FIELDS:
   - SNAPSHOT-RELATIVE (read under CODE_ROOT): code_paths entries; plan target_files
     that are file paths. Strip ONLY a trailing ":<digits>". A code_paths entry
     containing "://" is a URL/endpoint, NOT a file read. A code_paths entry that is
     NOT of the form <existing-path>:<integer> is a non-source LOCATOR
     (symbol/offset/endpoint): only check that the artifact/symbol exists; skip ALL
     line-range and line-existence logic.
   - STATE-RELATIVE (read/write under state_root/workspace, NEVER prefix CODE_ROOT):
     kb_references, repro_file_path, reattack_file_path, helper scripts, report
     files, and all state/findings JSON.
4. Never WRITE under CODE_ROOT when snapshot_pinned is true. Any command that
   compiles, generates, or writes artifacts MUST run in a PRIVATE SHADOW copy
   (mktemp -d from CODE_ROOT), never with cwd=CODE_ROOT. Read-only inspection may
   cd into CODE_ROOT.
5. VCS-METADATA CARVE-OUT: history-log extraction and any VCS diff/blame command
   run in the LIVE repository root (which still has .git/.hg/.repo), NOT CODE_ROOT
   (the snapshot copy strips VCS metadata). Do NOT stop merely because CODE_ROOT
   lacks .git/.hg/.repo.
6. Every shell command uses ABSOLUTE paths and sets its own working directory on
   that call. Do NOT assume the working directory persists between calls.
```

> [!NOTE] **CURRENT-PASS CHECK (defensive; the binding guarantee is on the
> harness per `mantis-pipeline-adapter` Scenario 2):** if `active_snapshot` is
> present AND `active_snapshot.pass != state.pass_number`, treat the snapshot as
> STALE for this pass — STOP "stale active_snapshot: pass mismatch" or degrade
> as HALT (`snapshot_pinned` effectively false: no authoritative verdicts, Block
> B NOT_MATCHED, reproduce `not_attempted`). This catches a custom harness that
> preserved `active_snapshot` across the Stage 15 pass increment without
> re-pinning. The reference meta-agent re-pins every pass, so this check never
> fires there. Block B itself cannot detect this (it is `snapshot_id`-only, not
> `pass`-aware).

**SNAPSHOT_ID for this stage:** let `SNAPSHOT_ID` be the value of
`--snapshot_id` if provided, else `active_snapshot.snapshot_id` from
`workspace/.mantis_state.json`. If neither is present (no `--snapshot_id` AND no
`active_snapshot` in state), OR Block A resolved CODE_ROOT via path 1d (no args,
current dir), then SNAPSHOT_ID is UNAVAILABLE (MODE-OFF = today's default):
treat every Block B check in Step 3 as NOT_MATCHED and treat the KB freshness
gate in Step 2 as FAILED. Do NOT stop; degrade as described below. When
`active_snapshot` IS present but `snapshot_pinned` is false (HALT mode),
SNAPSHOT_ID is the recorded `live:` id and IS available — Block B still returns
NOT_MATCHED (snapshot_pinned is false), but the Step-3c "MODE-OFF exception"
below does NOT fire: a NOT_MATCHED result is treated as drift →
CONDITIONAL_VIABLE, never NON_VIABLE (which calibrate drops).

Execute the critic evaluation as follows:

1. **Load Findings:** Read the JSON files in the `workspace/findings/`
   directory. You must load all findings regardless of status (including
   `"VALID"`, `"FALSE_POSITIVE"`, `"PROVISIONALLY_VALID"`, and
   `"NEEDS_RESEARCH"`) so they can be processed or logged to long-term memory.
   If none exist, notify the user.

2. **Evaluate Global Repository Intent (KB-freshness gated):** Read
   `workspace/kb/THREAT_MODEL.md` (if it exists). Check the **Deployment
   Intent** section.

   **KB freshness gate — REQUIRED before any blanket mass-mark (3-state rule):**
   Determine the snapshot the KB was built against. Read it from ONE of these
   sources (try in order, first match wins):

   1. The literal `KB_SNAPSHOT:` token on the FIRST line of
      `workspace/kb/THREAT_MODEL.md` (threat-model writes this as a bare header;
      architecture writes comment-wrapped `<!-- KB_SNAPSHOT: ... -->` on each KB
      file). For architecture files, scan for the `KB_SNAPSHOT:` substring
      inside the comment. Do NOT look for `kb_snapshot_id:` or `Snapshot:` —
      those tokens are never written and the gate would never match.
   2. Else the `kb_snapshot_id` value in `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (which
      architecture writes in its state-stamp step).
   3. Else `""` (no prior KB provenance). The blanket mass-mark below is gated
      as follows:

   - **MODE-OFF** (no `active_snapshot` in state — no `--sync`): SKIP the
     freshness gate entirely. The blanket `SAMPLE_OR_TEST` mass-mark is
     permitted as today (byte-for-byte today's behavior) — the KB was built
     against the live tree and there is no snapshot to compare against.
   - **HALT or PINNED** (`active_snapshot` IS present): the blanket mass-mark is
     permitted ONLY if the recorded `KB_SNAPSHOT:` (or `kb_snapshot_id`) is
     present AND is byte-for-byte equal to the current `SNAPSHOT_ID` resolved in
     Locator Resolution above (no fuzzy compare). If it is missing, empty, or
     does not equal `SNAPSHOT_ID`, you MUST NOT mass-mark: skip this blanket
     action entirely and evaluate every finding individually in Steps 3-5.

   Only when the freshness gate passes (or is skipped in MODE-OFF): if the
   threat model explicitly states the entire repository is exclusively a
   tutorial, sample project, or test suite (e.g.,
   `Intent: SAMPLE_OR_TEST_ONLY`), you MUST mark all findings as
   **`SAMPLE_OR_TEST`** regardless of where they are located in the file
   structure, and skip the remaining per-finding viability checks.

3. **Acquire Targeted Code Snippets (snapshot-matched):** For each finding where
   `status` is `"VALID"` or `"PROVISIONALLY_VALID"` (skip this and the following
   evaluation steps for `"FALSE_POSITIVE"` or `"NEEDS_RESEARCH"` findings):

   a. **Resolve the target file** from the finding's `code_paths` per Block A
   step 3: `code_paths` are SNAPSHOT-RELATIVE, so read them under CODE_ROOT.
   Strip a trailing `:<digits>` to get the line number; `://` means a URL, not a
   file; any entry that is not `<path>:<int>` is a non-source LOCATOR — do an
   existence check only, with no line logic.

   b. **Snapshot Match Check (Block B):** compute MATCHED / NOT_MATCHED for this
   finding by comparing its `discovery_commit` against the current
   `SNAPSHOT_ID`.

   ```
   SNAPSHOT MATCH CHECK for finding F (decides MATCHED vs NOT_MATCHED):
   1. If snapshot_pinned is false -> NOT_MATCHED. Stop.
   2. Read F.discovery_commit:
      - missing OR empty OR the literal "MIXED" -> NOT_MATCHED.
      - not exactly equal to SNAPSHOT_ID          -> NOT_MATCHED.
      - exactly equal to SNAPSHOT_ID              -> MATCHED.
   There is no other route to MATCHED; never fuzzy-compare. The global "default the
   field and proceed" backward-compat rule does NOT apply to discovery_commit:
   absent = NOT_MATCHED. (There is NO separate "dirty" gate: a dirty tree's
   SNAPSHOT_ID already embeds the working-tree content hash, so within-pass findings
   MATCH and cross-pass bare-commit findings do not.)
   ```

   c. **Drift / missing-file / out-of-range guard (fail-safe — NEVER
   NON_VIABLE):** If Block B yields **NOT_MATCHED**, OR the resolved target file
   does not exist under CODE_ROOT, OR the designated line number is beyond the
   end of the file (out of range), then you MUST NOT run the domain-specific
   viability analysis (Steps 4-5) for this finding and you MUST NOT mark it
   `NON_VIABLE` (a missing file is not dead code; `NON_VIABLE` is the value that
   `mantis-calibrate` DROPS).

   **Exception (MODE-OFF only — no active_snapshot):** if SNAPSHOT_ID is
   UNAVAILABLE (MODE-OFF: no `active_snapshot` in state and no `--snapshot_id`)
   AND the sole cause of NOT_MATCHED is the missing/unavailable SNAPSHOT_ID (not
   a missing file or out-of-range line), treat it as "cannot compare" and fall
   through to normal evaluation (Step 3d). This preserves today's behavior for
   non-sync runs. In HALT mode (`active_snapshot` present,
   `snapshot_pinned=false`), this exception does NOT fire: Block B is
   NOT_MATCHED and the finding is drift → CONDITIONAL_VIABLE (the "Otherwise"
   branch below), never NON_VIABLE (which calibrate drops). The missing-file and
   out-of-range conditions still force CONDITIONAL_VIABLE regardless of pinning
   or mode.

   **Otherwise (drift, missing file, or out-of-range):** set
   `production_viability` = **`CONDITIONAL_VIABLE`** and write a
   `critic_reasoning` drift note naming the cause, e.g.:
   `"Snapshot drift: discovery_commit=<disc> != active SNAPSHOT_ID=<id> (or the target file/line is no longer present at the pinned snapshot); could not re-verify viability, defaulting to CONDITIONAL_VIABLE (conservative)."`
   Then record the update via Step 6 and continue to the next finding. (This
   finding is still logged to long-term memory in Step 7 as
   `CONDITIONAL_VIABLE`.)

   d. **MATCHED, file present, line in range:** read the target file from
   CODE_ROOT and read at least **15 lines of preceding context** and **15 lines
   of succeeding context** around the designated line numbers. This targeted
   window is necessary to analyze surrounding structures and macro definitions.
   Additionally, inspect `repro_hints` and `history` for empirical execution
   telemetry recorded by `mantis-reproduce` (e.g. `build_profile`,
   `sanitizers_used`, `assertions_disabled`, `ingress_blocked`). Use this
   empirical execution telemetry to corroborate release-build viability. Proceed
   to Steps 4-5.

4. **Evaluate Domain-Specific Viability Constraints:**

   - **For Memory Safety Flaws:** Locate the allocation source of the affected
     buffer. Determine if it is allocated with safety margins or trailing
     padding. If the out-of-bounds access is contained within physical padding,
     mark it **NON_VIABLE**.
   - **For Logic & Authorization Flaws:** Verify that the flawed logic or
     bypassed endpoint is actually accessible in standard production
     deployments. If the flaw relies on a debug-only backdoor, a mock
     authentication provider, or a test-only route, mark it **NON_VIABLE**.

5. **Determine Viability Status:** Assign one of the following viability
   statuses to the finding to ensure we prioritize correctly:

   - **`NON_VIABLE`**: The flaw is unreachable or compiled-out in production.
     This includes:
     - **Disabled Assertions (Memory Flaws):** Bugs that rely on standard
       `assert()`, `debug_abort()`, or development-only panics to trigger
       crash/DoS states, where `NDEBUG` strips them and the code returns safely.
     - **Debug-Only Features:** Conditionally compiled with debug flags (e.g.
       `#ifdef DEBUG`).
     - **Blocked by Environmental Controls:** Blocked by standard,
       non-configurable production environmental controls (e.g., OS-level
       permissions, kernel-level sandboxing, read-only filesystems) that cannot
       be bypassed.
   - **`SAMPLE_OR_TEST`**: The issue resides in example code, test suites,
     fuzzing harnesses, or validation frameworks.
   - **`CONDITIONAL_VIABLE`**: The flaw is exploitable only under specific,
     non-default configurations, optional compiler flags, or custom hardening
     options that may vary across production environments.
   - **`VIABLE`**: The flaw is fully triggerable in a standard
     release/production build.

6. **Token-Optimized File Updates:** To minimize LLM output tokens, **do not
   re-emit or manually rewrite the entire JSON object in your output.** Instead,
   use in-place editing tools (like a short script in your preferred language,
   or `jq`) to programmatically append the new fields to the existing
   `workspace/findings/<id>.json` file.

   You must append the following to the existing object:

   - A `"production_viability"` field (`"VIABLE"`, `"NON_VIABLE"`,
     `"SAMPLE_OR_TEST"`, or `"CONDITIONAL_VIABLE"`).
   - A `"critic_reasoning"` field explaining your evaluation.
   - An entry to the `"history"` array:

   ```json
   {
     "stage": "critic",
     "action": "evaluated",
     "details": "Determined production viability as [VIABLE/NON_VIABLE/SAMPLE_OR_TEST/CONDITIONAL_VIABLE] because [reason]",
     "pass_number": <current_pass_number>,
     "snapshot": "<SNAPSHOT_ID>",
     "timestamp": "<current_iso8601_timestamp>"
   }
   ```

   Set `"snapshot"` to the `SNAPSHOT_ID` resolved in Locator Resolution. If
   `SNAPSHOT_ID` is UNAVAILABLE (MODE-OFF), set it to `""` (or omit the key). Do
   not fabricate an id.

7. **Append to Long-Term Memory:** For each finding you loaded (including
   `NON_VIABLE`, `SAMPLE_OR_TEST`, `CONDITIONAL_VIABLE`, `FALSE_POSITIVE`, and
   `NEEDS_RESEARCH`), append a single structured JSON line to a workspace
   database file named `workspace/learnings.jsonl` (using append mode). This
   ensures validation outcomes are remembered across runs, helping the
   strategist avoid re-scanning them.

   - **Memory Entry Format:**
     `{"title": "[security_flaw_title]", "code_paths": ["[path1:line1]"], "status": "[VIABLE / CONDITIONAL_VIABLE / NON_VIABLE / SAMPLE_OR_TEST / FALSE_POSITIVE / NEEDS_RESEARCH]", "snapshot": "[current SNAPSHOT_ID, or omit in MODE-OFF]"}`

When complete, notify the user.
